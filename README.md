NOTE: I am using Render to host my backend for Free and It's having Cors Issue on free plan. I tested the whole program in Local Machine/`localhost` and it's working. So if the issue occurs in Live Project for you please use this [CORS unblock extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) and it will start working normally in your browser.
